# Introductory Bioinformatics with Python

I am a Biochemistry undergraduate exploring bioinformatics and computational biology.

This repository contains simple Python scripts I am using to learn how biological data can be analyzed computationally.

## Current Work

- DNA nucleotide counting using Python
- DNA nucleotide counting
- GC content calculation

- Reading DNA sequences from files
- Computing nucleotide composition and GC content

Handled file encoding issues when loading biological datasets
