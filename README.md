Gene Expression Analysis Using Python

📌 Overview:

This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics data analysis using Python.  
It involves reading gene expression data from a CSV file, performing statistical analysis, computing GC content, and visualizing gene expression levels.

🧬 Features
- File-based gene expression analysis
- Calculation of average expression levels
- GC content calculation from DNA sequences
- Data visualization using matplotlib

🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib

📊 Sample Output
- Tabular gene expression data
- Bar chart of gene expression levels

🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as part of my bioinformatics learning journey and aligns with my interest in molecular biology and computational analysis of biological data.

This project also serves as a pilot learning module under the STEMIA Project & Research Assistance Scheme, aimed at building computational capacity among STEM students in Africa.

📂 Files
- `analyze_gene_expression.py` – main analysis script
- `gene_expression.csv` – input dataset
