Gene Expression Analysis Using Python

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics data analysis using Python.  
It involves reading gene expression data from a CSV file, performing statistical analysis, computing GC content, and visualizing gene expression levels.

🧬 Features
- File-based gene expression analysis
- Calculation of average expression levels
- GC content calculation from DNA sequences
- Data visualization using matplotlib

🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib

📊 Sample Output
- Tabular gene expression data
- Bar chart of gene expression levels

🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as part of my bioinformatics learning journey and aligns with my interest in molecular biology and computational analysis of biological data.

📂 Files
- `analyze_gene_expression.py` – main analysis script
- `gene_expression.csv` – input dataset
